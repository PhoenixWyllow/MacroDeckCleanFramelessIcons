# Clean Frameless
a set of simple, clean icons, without frames, for Macro Deck 2

Custom icons, made with care.

For their *framed* counterparts, see [Clean Framed](https://github.com/PhoenixWyllow/MacroDeckCleanFramedIcons)

### Want more icons?

I'm looking to add more icons, but with work and life, I can only spend time making what you might want.
